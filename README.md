# Beginner-Coding-Projects
Welcome to the Beginner Coding Projects repository! Here you will find a collection of simple and fun coding projects that are perfect for beginners.

The projects included in this repository are:

A to-do list app that allows a user to add, edit and delete tasks. The app is able to store the tasks in a text file or a database and display them in a user-friendly 
format.

A calculator that can perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator also has a feature to perform square 
root and exponential calculations.

A guessing game that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and prompts the user to guess it. The game gives hints to the user if the guess is too high or too low, 
and tracks the number of attempts made.

A program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The program takes user input and displays the converted temperature.

A program that generates a random password with a specified length and complexity (e.g. including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters).

A program that performs basic text manipulation like reversing a string, counting the number of words in a sentence, and removing vowels from a string.

A program that simulates a simple game like rock-paper-scissors, tic-tac-toe, or hangman. The game has a simple graphical interface and allows for one or two players.

A program that keeps track of a shopping list, allowing users to add and remove items, and save and load the list from a file.
The code is well commented and easy to follow, making it perfect for learning and experimenting.

I hope you enjoy working on these projects and that they help you improve your coding skills. Happy coding!
